# VBS-Malware
VBScript is an old interpreted language that automates system administration tasks, but it can also be used for malware. I wrote a couple of VBScript malware tools that may inspire other penetration testers and security researchers to develop their tools.

Steps:
1. Open Notepad.
2. Copy and paste the exact code given below.
(The Attacks can be explored further, all you need to do is Right Click on the file and goto Show More Options and click "Edit")
3. Write any VB Script code.
4. Save notepad as Test.vbs on desktop. Once you will save notepad with script with the file extension .vbs.
5. Double click on the file to run the script.

To make things more intresting add a fake Shortcut to some system file/folder that originally is a shortcut to your prank attack.

Create an awesome computer Virus prank, this is harmless and does not affect anything, this is the secure way to create prank virus.
